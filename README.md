# WorkFlow
A shell script that will act as a lightweight todo manager. Needs work 


On first use run open up the file and replace "#EMAIL HERE" with your preferred email.
Also run 
chmod +x calendar.sh
so that the permissions will work. Once again, super lightweight. 


To run the file, run this command in the place you saved it: 
./calendar.sh

Needs some work.
